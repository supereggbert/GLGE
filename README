WHAT IS GLGE?

GLGE is a javascript library intended to ease the use of WebGL; which is 
basically a native browser javascript API giving direct access to openGL 
ES2, allowing for the use of hardware accelerated 2D/3D applications 
without having to download any plugins.

The aim of GLGE is to mask the involved nature of WebGL from the web 
developer, who can then spend his/her time creating richer content for 
the web.

GLGE is made available under a BSD (3-point) style license

BUILDING GLGE

GLGE requires nodejs, to build simply:
> git submodule init
> git submodule update
> ./build.js

For more options:
> ./build.js --help

RUNNING THE EXAMPLES LOCALLY IN CHROME

Chrome doesn't  support cross-origin requests which means running from a 
file:/// url doesn't work. You can start a small webserver using Python:
> cd /path/to/glge
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1234

Now open: http://localhost:1234/examples/
